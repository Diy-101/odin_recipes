    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Serve these pancakes with butter and syrup, or up the ante with toppings such as sprinkles, chopped bittersweet chocolate, and sliced or chopped fruit for a perfect breakfast.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened, or as needed, for greasing, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>toppings of choice, e.g. maple syrup or fruit, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps for cooking</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid measuring cup.        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a second bowl.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk together.
        <br>Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just combined. 
        <br>(Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest 3 minutes and gently stir again.        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Melt some butter on the griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel.
        <br>(You want just a bit of a sheen; donâ€™t overgrease the griddle.)
        <br>Spoon batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bubbles form on surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2 minutes more.
        <br>Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with butter and toppings</li>
    </ol>
